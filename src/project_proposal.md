Guess The Song Soundtrack

The Project I am going to be going with for my Capstone is going to be the Guess The Song, I am going to call the website Guessify (taking the 'ify' from 'Spotify').

What tech stack will you use for your final project?
- What I plan on using for this project is JavaScript, React, CSS, MongoDB, and CSS.
Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application? 
- I think that I am going to make it pretty evenly focused. A lot of this project is going to be me working with Spotify's API and making it all work properly seems like 70% of the work. I do want to put a lot of effort into a clean UI, I want my UI to take some inspiration from Wordle from the NYT but also a LOT from Spotify's UI, I want the app to look like they made it. I like how sleek it is and not too much on the screen. 
Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
- This will be a website for sure, I will make it accessible by phone though with dynamic CSS/HTML. 

What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
- I want my website to be a game that many users can use. I plan on finding ways to release it to the public and seeing if it is something that users on the internet might be interested in and I can see the potential in it if I can do it right. Another goal I have with this is to reinforce a lot of the skills I have and be able to learn/practice a lot of the technologies I have learned up to this point. 

What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?
- The demographic for this app will be people who enjoy music and can enjoy guessing/competitive games.

What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? 
- I will be using Spotifys API which I will be using with Axios.


My Approach

What does your database schema look like? 
- Since my API im using has a lot of its own data I can use from it, the main thing I am wanting for my own database is user game session information, like highscores, and songs they guessed correctly

What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? This is especially important if you are creating your own API, web scraping produces notoriously messy data. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure? 
- An issue I may run into is trying to get user data from the api and how it would work since I am not familiar with this api. 

What functionality will your app include?
- I want users to sign into their spotify account, then they can choose from any of their playlists/other playlists, any genres, or any album. Then the game starts, the idea is that the user will hear a short, random snippet of their song. The user then has three guesses to what the name of the song is, if they are wrong they can restart/quit. If they are right they can keep getting random songs until they lose. At that point their high score will be saved to the leaderboard, which can then be compared globally to all users or just their friends. 

What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your stretch goals? 
- Stretch goals I have for this project is posting it publicly online and trying to get a lot of real users, and continuing to update and make it great as users request.
