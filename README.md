Spotify Snippet Guessing Game!

This is my so far biggest project yet, a game involving the use of Spotifys Api.
The game is simple, you select a playlist/album from your saved songs and a random song will be picked from it. 
Your job is to hear the snippet, and make a guess at what the name of the song is, the catch is though if you get it wrong 3 times you are out. 
Compete with your friends to see who can guess the most songs.
See how high you can rank on the leaderboard!

More features coming soon, app is a complete WIP.

STEPS TO COMPLETION
1. Front End Complete with API, React Router, CSS, and Axios.
2. Then Add the features that will require firebase after that is complete
3. Then Deploy to Vercel
