Spotify Snippet Guessing Game!

Link to Game - https://official-capstone.vercel.app/

This is my so far biggest project yet, a game involving the use of Spotifys Api.
The game is simple, you select a playlist/album from your saved songs and a random song will be picked from it. 
Your job is to hear the snippet, and make a guess at what the name of the song is, the catch is though if you get it wrong 3 times you are out. 
Compete with your friends to see who can guess the most songs.
See how high you can rank on the leaderboard!
