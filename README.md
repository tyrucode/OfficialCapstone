# Guessify!
### The Spotify Snippet Guessing Game!

---

## Description

This is my so far biggest project yet, a game involving the use of Spotify's API.  
The game is simple:  
You select a playlist/album from your saved songs, and a random song will be picked from it.  
Your job is to hear the snippet and guess the name of the song.  
The catch? If you get it wrong 3 times, you're out.  

Compete with your friends to see who can guess the most songs.  
See how high you can rank on the leaderboard!
